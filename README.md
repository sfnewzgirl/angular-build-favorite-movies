## Objectives
* Build an app with Angular

This was my first time incorporating all the Angular lessons and labs in one place on an individual project, including more modular code with controllers, services, and directives.

* Use an external API

I have struggled with external APIs in past lessons and labs, so I made this a top priority. I wanted to solidify best practices for tapping into external APIs and accomplish this personal goal.

* Explore a new styling framework

I have solely used Bootstrap to compliment my CSS and was interested in exploring a new framework this time around. I pick Material Design Lite.
